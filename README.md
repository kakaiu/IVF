### IVF - A scalable solution of constructing and distributing interactive graph visualization systems

Constructing and distributing interactive graph visualization systems are necessary to observe on linked objects and understand complex systems. Building a graph visualization is easy since mature tools are existed for it, such as Gephi. However, embedding high-level interactions into the visualization and constructing a sustainable system are complicated works.

To address this challenge, we design a solution with a proposed file format (IVF). By writing interaction and visualization in IVF files, interactive graph visualization systems can be achieved without facing many empirical issues, like system implementing and executive environment. Rather these interactive systems can stably run everywhere with IVF readers, even for the large graph with billions of nodes.
